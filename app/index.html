	    <p>I am a community artist, organizer, and educator whose primary focus is in knowledge and equity expansion through accessible creative engagement. I have been working as an educator and programming/events coordinator for almost a decade, primarily in community arts based settings. After years in front line work, I now offer consultation and training on equity based practices that are crucial to those engaged in any kind of work striving for safer and welcoming environments. I have worked with a wide range of demographics from public community trainings, to non for profit organizations, to businesses and educational institutions. I specialize in employee training, group trainings, service provider and user trainings, as well as policy building and accessibility audits.</p>

		<p>Officially, I have a fine arts degree in Photography from OCAD University and a diploma from the Assaulted Women and Children’s Counselling and Advocacy program at George Brown College. I am a professionally trained facilitator, though I must give credit to all the grassroots community organizers, educators, healers, elders, makers, and land protectors who have taught me the majority of what I know about equity. I would not be able to do this work had they not paved the way and shared their wisdom with me. I am forever learning and growing as an individual and as an educator.</p>

		<p>I am based in Montreal, Quebec, unceded territory of the Kahnawa:Ke Mohawk and Haudenosaunee First Nations. Outside of this work, I wear the hats of a musician, writer, and herbal medicine student.</strong></p>

	<h3 class="faq-question__title">Why Equity Training?</h3>
	<p>Equity trainings provide a controlled and safe learning environment for people who wish to expand their knowledge of diversity. They provide learning opportunities and a closed space to ask questions and seek understanding. Many work environments are lacking in what many call ‘diversity and sensitivity’ training, which means that employees and staff alike are witnessing, experiencing or enacting harmful behaviours, resulting in stressful or unsafe work environments for those affected or targeted. Often, this hurtful behaviour is not done on purpose, but because we might not be aware that our actions are rooted in harmful (otherwise known as oppressive) biases. Examples of this might be sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and many other isms. There are a vast array of ways in which these biases show up in our behaviours. Equity trainings are a starting point to help workers, students, service providers/users; anyone, really, to start examining these biases and work towards creating safer and more inclusive spaces.</p>

<div class="faq-question">
<h3 class="faq-question__title">Do you provide Anti-Racist Training?</h3>
<p>All of my trainings use an intersectional analysis, which always includes discussions racism and how racialized people’s experiences intersect with other areas of oppression. However, I do not provide a training specifically on anti-racism because I think you should hire a person of colour to do this and pay them well! Need a recommendation? <a>Ask me!</a></p>
</div>

<h3 class="faq-question__title">Do you do Custom Training?</h3>
<p>Each training has a basic skeleton of topics and activities, which can be modified to meet your group’s needs and goals. I will always do a quick intake with prospective participants to see what they are looking for, in order to ensure your group gets the most out of your training.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question__title">Do you offer Sliding Scale Rates?</h3>
<p>I offer limited sliding scale spots for collectives, groups and organizations that do not receive major funding. To see if you apply,<a>Ask me!</a></p>
</div>

<div class="row__medium-3">
<div class="faq-question">
<h3 class="faq-question__title">What Accessibility Accommodations do you offer?</h3>
<p>I’m always down to discuss how to make trainings more accessible for your group. Handouts and visuals can be provided at your request. Things like projections, note taking, American Sign Language and translation can be provided at an additional expense. I have lots of experience working with interpreters and conducting accessibility audits. All workshops that I offer to the public strive to be physically accessible.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question__title">How do I book a Training?</h3>
<p>To book a training, simply contact me and let me know what you're looking for. The more details the better. Together we'll make sure to tailor a training suited to meet the needs of your group or team.</p>
